# Declare V3

Welcome to another version of the Declare JavaScript library for the web! It
uses a different approach with the same beliefs.

There are a few principles here:

 * Compose your data & methods
 * A library shouldn't dictate how to write your site
 * Source should be small, easy to read, and easy to replace
 * Use what your browser gave you
 * Write simple functions

Please see the `test.html` for example of how to use the library.
