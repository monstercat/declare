# Declare V3

Welcome to another version of the Declare JavaScript library for the web! It
uses a different approach with the same belief that you should what the browser
gives you to build your site!

There are a few principles here:

 * Use what your browser gave you
 * Write simple functions
 * Compose your data & methods
 * Use native events to drive reactions

Please see the `test.html` for example of how to use the library.
